This artifact represents a collaborative group machine learning project completed as part of the MSc Artificial Intelligence programme. The project focused on applying classical machine learning techniques to analyse and interpret real-world data, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualisation, clustering, and regression, with the aim of uncovering meaningful patterns and relationships within the dataset.

As **Team Leader**, I coordinated group meetings, managed project timelines, and ensured accountability across the team. Collaboration was facilitated through shared platforms such as GitHub and Google Drive, enabling transparent version control, structured task management, and real-time document editing. I also compiled and edited the final group report, ensuring a cohesive narrative, consistent analysis, and clear presentation of results.

This artifact includes:
- Group machine learning project report  
- Team contract and meeting documentation  
- Peer evaluation materials and feedback summary  

Through this project, I strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and applied data analysis skills, while gaining practical experience in collaboratively developing and evaluating machine learning models. The work also reinforced the importance of ethical collaboration, clear communication, and adaptability when working within distributed technical teams.
