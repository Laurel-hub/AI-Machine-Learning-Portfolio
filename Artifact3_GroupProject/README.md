This artefact represents our group project for the module, where we collaboratively developed a machine learning model to analyse and interpret healthcare-related data. The project involved applying data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualisation, clustering, and regression techniques to uncover meaningful insights and relationships within the dataset.

As Team Leader, I coordinated team meetings, managed the group timeline, and ensured accountability through shared platforms such as GitHub and Google Drive. These tools allowed transparent collaboration, version control, and real-time document editing. I also compiled and edited the final report, ensuring a cohesive structure and clear presentation of our results.

The project strengthened my leadership, teamwork, and data analysis skills, while deepening my understanding of how machine learning techniques can be collaboratively applied to complex health datasets. It also reinforced my appreciation of ethical teamwork, communication, and adaptability within distributed teams.
