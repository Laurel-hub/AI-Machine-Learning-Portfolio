# Machine Learning Projects (MSc Artificial Intelligence)

This repository showcases a selection of applied machine learning projects completed as part of my MSc in Artificial Intelligence.  
The work demonstrates my ability to design, evaluate, and communicate machine learning solutions while considering ethical, legal, and collaborative dimensions of AI development.

Rather than focusing purely on academic outcomes, this portfolio highlights transferable industry skills including:
- Problem framing and model selection
- Supervised learning and neural networks
- Model evaluation and interpretation
- Responsible and ethical AI considerations
- Technical communication and teamwork
