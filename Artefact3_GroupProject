## Artifact 3: Machine Learning Group Project – Leadership and Collaboration Reflection

This artifact presents our group’s Machine Learning report, which focused on applying exploratory data analysis, clustering, regression, and data visualization techniques to a real-world dataset. As the team leader, my primary role was to coordinate meetings, assign responsibilities, and compile the final report. We used **GitHub** for version control and **Google Drive** for shared document editing to ensure transparency, accountability, and real-time collaboration.  

I was responsible for drafting the introduction, managing submissions, and ensuring our **team contract** reflected every member’s input and agreement. Communication was maintained mainly through **WhatsApp**, accommodating different time zones and internet restrictions.  

This project strengthened my leadership, communication, and people management skills. I learned to navigate cultural and time-based differences effectively, motivate team members, and maintain progress through clear deadlines. It also deepened my understanding of **data analytics workflows**, team-based model development, and the importance of **collaborative problem-solving**.  

Through this experience, I developed transferable skills in coordination, decision-making, and technical writing that will benefit my academic and professional projects.
