## Artifact 4: Individual Presentation – Neural Network Models for Object Recognition

This artifact includes my individual project presentation for the topic *“Neural Network Models for Object Recognition Using Multi-Track ML Approaches.”*  
I completed **Track 2 (Deep Learning)**, where I implemented a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** using the **CIFAR-10 dataset**. The task involved data preprocessing, model training, validation, and evaluating performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, and confusion matrices.

I found this project both challenging and rewarding. Initially, I faced difficulties in understanding model architecture and tuning hyperparameters. However, through self-learning and experimentation, I gained confidence in concepts such as **data augmentation**, **one-hot encoding**, and **transfer learning**. Seeing how these methods enhanced the model’s performance and could be applied to real-world problems—such as healthcare imaging or autonomous vehicles—was particularly inspiring.

This artifact represents my ability to apply theoretical knowledge from the course to practical AI tasks. It also improved my technical communication and problem-solving abilities, especially when creating my 20-minute presentation and transcript. Overall, it demonstrated my growth as a reflective, technically competent AI practitioner.
