This artefact showcases my individual project presentation for Track 2 (Deep Learning), where I developed and evaluated convolutional neural network (CNN) models using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The task involved applying deep learning techniques such as data augmentation, one-hot encoding, and hyperparameter tuning to improve model accuracy and generalisation.

The presentation demonstrates my ability to train, validate, and interpret CNN performance metrics, as well as reflect on the advantages and trade-offs of deep learning compared to other machine learning approaches. I also discuss practical challenges encountered, including GPU limitations in Google Colab and model optimisation.

Together, these materials illustrate both the technical depth and reflective insight gained from implementing neural networks for object recognition, and how these skills can be applied to healthcare image analysis and other real-world AI applications.
